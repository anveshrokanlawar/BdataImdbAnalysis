## Introduction:
 In this project, we will be predicting about which director has highest rating, lowest rating,    average rating and finding the count of rating by the end of the project. Through this, we can predict the popularity of the director.

<br/>

#### Data Source Description
- The provided dataset is imdb reviews and movie ratings.Data is saved in .csv format with text data.
- Some of the key attributes are Title, Year, Director, Votes.
- VOLUME: The dataset is of size 164 MB with 81,273 rows and 22 columns. The source of the dataset is publicly available website https://www.imdb.com.
- VARIETY: The data available is in structured format.
- VELOCITY: The velocity of the dataset is medium. It is the monthly dataset and it was last updated 2 months ago.
- VERACITY: The data looks clean without any messy and is trustworthy as the data is obtained(Scraped) from publicly available website. But there are few empty fields in some columns on which we are not performing any computing operations.
- VALUE: From the data we can predict, towards which director movies are the people most interested or eagerly waiting to watch. This data would be useful for filmmaker to get collaborated with the top directors based on the data to make more profits.
